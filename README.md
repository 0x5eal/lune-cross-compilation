[![CI](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)
[![Release](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune/actions/workflows/release.yaml)

A [Luau](https://luau-lang.org) script runner

---

üöÄ Use the ergonomics and readability of Luau instead of shell scripts üöÄ

[Full example & walkthrough](.lune/hello_lune.luau)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

The preferred way of installing Lune is using [Aftman](https://github.com/lpghatguy/aftman).

This will add `lune` to an `aftman.toml` file in the current directory, or create one if it does not exist:

```sh
aftman add filiptibell/lune
```

You can also download pre-built binaries for most systems directly from the GitHub Releases page.

**_With Lune & Luau:_**

```lua

    if count == 5 then
        break
    end
    count += 1
end

<summary><b>üßë‚Äçüíª Configuring VSCode for Lune</b></summary>

Lune puts developer experience first, and as such provides type definitions and configurations for several tools out of the box.

<details>
<summary>Luau LSP</summary>

1. Use `lune --download-luau-types` to download Luau types (`luneTypes.d.luau`) to the current directory
2. Set your definition files setting to include `luneTypes.d.luau`
3. Set the require mode setting to `relativeToFile`

En example of these settings can be found in the [.vscode](.vscode) folder in this repository

</details>

<details>

<summary>Selene</summary>

1. Use `lune --download-selene-types` to download Selene types (`lune.yml`) to the current directory
2. Use either `std = "luau+lune"`, or `std = "roblox+lune"` if your project also contains Roblox-specific code, in your `selene.toml` configuration file

</details>
<br>

**_NOTE:_** _It is highly recommended to add any type definition files to your `.gitignore` and to only download them using these commands, since this guarantees that you have type definitions compatible with your installed version of Lune._

</details>

## üèÉ Running Lune Scripts

After you've written a script file, for example `script-name.luau`, you can run it:

```sh
lune script-name
```

This will look for the file `script-name.luau` in a few locations:

- The current directory
- The folder `lune` in the current directory, if it exists
- The folder `.lune` in the current directory, if it exists

If you don't want Lune to look in sub-directories you can provide a full file path with the file extension included, instead of only the file name. <br>

---

**_NOTE:_** _Lune also supports files with the `.lua` extension but using the `.luau` extension is highly recommended._
