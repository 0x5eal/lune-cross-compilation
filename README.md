## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Using [Aftman](https://github.com/lpghatguy/aftman)

The preferred way of installing Lune.

This will add `lune` to an `aftman.toml` file in the
current directory, or create one if it does not exist.

```sh
$ aftman add filiptibell/lune
```

### From [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/filiptibell/lune/releases)

You can also download pre-built binaries for most
systems directly from the linked GitHub Releases page.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Writing Lune Scripts

First things first, check out the examples of how to write a script in the [.lune](.lune) folder! <br>
Lune has many useful built-in globals and APIs to use to interact with your system, and can do things
such as read/write files, run external programs, serialize & deserialize json, and much more.

## üèÉ Running Lune Scripts

When you've written a script with either a `.lua` or `.luau` extension, you can run it:

```sh
$ lune script-name
```

This will look for the script `script_name` in a few locations:

- The current directory
- The folder `lune` in the current directory, if it exists
- The folder `.lune` in the current directory, if it exists

If you don't want Lune to look in sub-directories you can provide a full
file path with the file extension included, instead of only the file name.
